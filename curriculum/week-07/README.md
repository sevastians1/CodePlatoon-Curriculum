# Why is it important?
- Django's ORM offers a streamlined and intuitive way for Python applications to interact with SQL databases, as opposed to tediously writing raw SQL queries.
- Using Django's ORM will allow you to easily modify and access databases using an object-oriented, 'python-istic' approach.
- Django is a wildly popular python framework used for building websites, and will likely be a large part of any web developer's job.
- Django's MVC (model, view, controller) setup is analogous to countless other frameworks you'll work with as a developer.
