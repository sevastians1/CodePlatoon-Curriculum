# Weekly Topics:
- Connecting our Django API to our React frontend
- Individual projects

# Lecture Videos:
- [Week 10 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb0D5JeYu38&list=PLu0CiQ7bzwES-jDWblHChNrxC1YuSn44Y)

# Why is it important?
- So far, we've mostly been developing separate (django) back-ends and (react) front-ends. This week, we'll put them together into a single full-stack project.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Access Django backends through React frontends to create a full-fledged web application.
2. Have a better understanding of the inner workings of full web apps and build them more efficiently.

# Afternoon Breakout Sessions (optional):
1. Django Serializers Review
2. Anything else?

# Individual Project:
- The individual project will be your last assessment of the course, assessment #5. It'll push your creativity and technical skills, preparing you for your group capstone project, and for your professional life outside of the cohort.
- You will be required to write a full-stack web app, including CRUD, routing, testing, and at least 2 3rd party APIs. Here are the full requirements:
- For inspiration, take a look at this compiled list of public 3rd party APIs: [Github list of 3rd Party APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) & [API & React Library Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G3Mu5WBk28_SYQsmOaYWIn6C4Wk21SOSGKrvnJstN1I/edit?usp=sharing)
- Additionally, here are some ideas to get you started: [Previous Student's Personal Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPSWu-4uY4AA0Xxw8-UGbBw51ATVdDKegD-qCzlglUk/)
