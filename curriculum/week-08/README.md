# Weekly Topics:
- Creating apps with React  
- Using JavaScript and the concept of destructuring to organize code efficiently
- Fetch and JavaScript promises

# Lecture Videos:

# Why is it important?
- React is a JavaScript library you will use in web development to make elements of your interface that users can interact with—not just view—which is a requirement for most applications and projects you will work on. 
- React is the most popular and most in-demend front-end framework today and will continue to be since it was developed and supported by Facebook.
- For real-world applications, which are much larger and more complex than these challenges, JS is necessary to reduce repetative lines of code; the JS expression destructuring assignment syntax will also be helpful for "cleaning-up" your code.
- Promises is a JS concept that allows us to make calls to web services. Understanding this concept is necessary for using fetch to bring dynamic data from an external source into an app you're building.  

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Write object oriented programs in JS (classes, constructors, methods, instance variables) 
2. Create a default React app
3. Create and use both class-based components and functional components in React apps and translate between the two types of components
4. Understand and utilize the React concepts of props and state 
5. Use JS to organize your code efficiently 
6. Understand the concept of destructuring in JS and use it to declare new variables 
7. Understand the concept of promises in JS and how they allow us to make calls to web services
8. Clearly express the history of the web and why we used, but no longer use, AJAX
9. Use fetch to get asynchronous data from external sources and bring it into a React app

# Afternoon Breakout Sessions (optional):
