# Weekly Topics:
- Axios and JavaScript promises (Introduced in Week 5)
- React Hooks and Component Lifecycles

# Lecture Videos:
- [Week 9 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncIbjV3INZE&list=PLu0CiQ7bzwESS9BU10Ut5r2MprRmrDbsk)

# Why is it important?
- Promises is the JS concept that allows us to easily perform async operations, like make calls to web services. Understanding this concept is necessary for using fetch to bring dynamic data from an external source into an app you're building.
- Component lifecycles allow you to hook into a React class component at a particular stage, which has various effects. As a developer, you'll want certain important requests, such as calling out to you API, to happen at a certain stage and you'll use lifecycle methods to do so.
- React Hooks allow us to achieve a similar effect to lifecycle methods in functional components; this will become more important to apps you build as React moves away from class components.

# Afternoon Breakout Sessions (optional):
1. JavaScript Axios API Review
2. Class Based Components vs. Functional Based Components Review
3. Anything else?

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. Understand the concept of promises in JS and how they allow us to make calls to web services
2. Clearly express the history of the web and why we use AJAX
3. Use axios to get asynchronous data from external sources and bring it into a React app
4. Use the lifecycle method componentDidMount() to connect to your API from a React class component
5. Use the React hook useEffect() to connect to your API from a React functional component
6. Create a Django API that returns JSON to be used in ReactJS
