# Why is it important?
- Modules/Packages are essential to software development since it allows you to perform specific tasks without having to reinvent the wheel or solve a problem from scratch
- Recursion is important because it often allows a breathtakingly simple algorithmic solution to certain problems that would otherwise be practically unobtainable with an iterative algorithm.
- Understanding the basics of regex to help solve technical problems when other approaches are more cumbersome
